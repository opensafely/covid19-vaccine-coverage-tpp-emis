# About the OpenSAFELY framework

The OpenSAFELY framework is a secure analytics platform for electronic health records
research in the NHS.

Instead of requesting access for slices of patient data and transporting them elsewhere
for analysis, the framework supports developing analytics against dummy data, and then
running against the real data *within the same infrastructure that the data is stored*.
